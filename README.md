# Technion-CTF
Some of the scripts of the 3rd place division 1 winners, Psagot22. The competition was held in November and December 2020. In division 1, the teams were comprised of students studying first and second year in the Taub Faculty of Computer Science at the Technion.
Psagot22 has achieved 8510 points in the CTF, arriving at 10th place overall. In this repository are the scripts I wrote for the team. See also: https://github.com/idankdev/CS-Technion-CTF for another team member's scripts. 

Many of the scripts in my repository are total garbage - I just put every script I used here, the code isn't great because it's not meant to be great. Nor will all the scripts here even work (you can ask me which ones should work and I'll look). I did filter out scripts that did not assist at all in the solving of their respective challenge.
