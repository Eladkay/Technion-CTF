# Technion-CTF
Some of the scripts of the 3rd place division 1 winners, Psagot22. The competition was held in November and December 2020. In division 1, the teams were comprised of students studying first and second year in the Taub Faculty of Computer Science at the Technion.
Psagot22 has achieved 8510 points in the CTF, arriving at 10th place overall. In this repository are the scripts I wrote for the team. See also: https://github.com/idankdev/CS-Technion-CTF for another team member's scripts.
